//
// THE RULE IS THE DETECTOR'S. `'s` already reads as "is" and "has", so a field
// named `is bankrupt` says the verb twice; the name must start at the
// complement. This file does not restate that rule, does not carry its own idea
// of what an identifier looks like, and does not keep a second copy of the
// exemption list. It IMPORTS all of it:
//
//     CLITIC · DECL · EXEMPT · MARKER · EXTS · SKIP_DIRS · scanText · walk
//
// That import is the point of the file's shape. Two earlier appliers were
// written and thrown away (#386's, and this one's first draft), each with its
// own hand-rolled pattern, and a detector and applier that merely AGREE today
// are a pair that will disagree the first time either is tuned. There is one
// definition of a clitic-verb name in this repository and it lives next door.
//
// Usage:
//   node etc/apply-clitic-sweep.mjs --check    <dir>...   exit 1 if any pending
//   node etc/apply-clitic-sweep.mjs --dry-run  <dir>...   show them, exit 0
//   node etc/apply-clitic-sweep.mjs            <dir>...   apply them

// --- WHAT IT REPLACES, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO ------------------------------
//
// ONLY DELIMITED OCCURRENCES, in three forms:
//
//     `name`        backticked — how L4 spells an identifier
//     "name"        a whole JSON or JS string
//     \`name\`      an escaped backtick — L4 written inside a JS template literal
//
// The third is not hypothetical and was not obvious. MEASURED: sg-succession's
// `app/build-scenarios.mjs` generates L4 inside a template literal, so its
// identifiers are backslash-backtick, and the plain form does not match them.
// Without this case the applier silently skipped the file that generates the
// app's scenario fixtures — no error, just an app emitting the OLD field name
// against a swept encoding, disagreeing with the law it renders.
//
// NEVER BARE TEXT, and that is the load-bearing refusal. MEASURED in canon at
// `sg/child-support/registers/fork-register.json:341`, the phrase "is the
// natural father" occurs inside a QUOTATION OF THE STATUTE — "... if (a) the
// male employee is the natural father of the qualifying child". A bare-text
// sweep edits a legal quotation into something the Act does not say, silently.
// The same shape appears in a comment at `sg-csp.l4:332`. Delimiters are what
// separate an identifier from a sentence, which is why matching is defined by
// them and not by word boundaries.
//
// `tests/` is never entered: goldens are REGENERATED from swept sources by the
// l4 binary. Hand-editing a golden blesses output nothing produced.

// exactly the harm this function exists to prevent. Widening to "the name
// appears backticked anywhere" was measured and is too blunt: `a Singapore
// citizen` already appears backticked in a sibling corpus that #386 swept, so

// The corpus searched for hazards is wider than the first version's on the axis
// that was simply wrong, and DELIBERATELY NOT wider on the axis that looked
// wrong and is not.
//
//   TYPE -- fixed. `collect` reads the detector's EXTS (.l4/.md), but the sweep
//   WRITES .json/.mjs/.js/.ts/..., so a binding sitting in a deposit or a
//   generator was structurally invisible to the hazard check. It now searches at
//   WRITE_EXTS.
//
//   SCOPE -- left as the directories you name, and that is a judgement worth
//   recording because the obvious "search the whole repository" is WRONG. It was
//   built and measured: repo-wide, `has renounced the right to such grant` ->
//   `renounced the right to such grant` is HELD, because the target is bound in
//   `jl4/examples/legal/sg-succession/sg-paa.l4` -- a different corpus that #386
//   already swept. That is not a collision, it is the same field in another copy,
//   and holding it back would have blocked a rename the real sweep applied. L4
//   names are scoped per module and reached through imports; a binding in an
//   unrelated corpus is not in scope and never could be.
//
//   So the corpus you pass IS the collision domain, and you are asserting it by
//   passing it. The run prints how many files it searched so that assertion is
//   visible rather than implied.
//
// WITH ONE ADDITION, AND IT IS THE PRINCIPLED ONE: `jl4-core/libraries` is
// always in the domain. The rule above is about IMPORT REACHABILITY -- a binding
// nothing can import is not a collision -- and the libraries are the modules
// that nearly everything DOES import, prelude first. A rename target that
// collides with a library binding is a real collision the run would otherwise be
// unable to see.
//
// MEASURED 2026-09-16, before adding it: over `jl4/examples/canon`,
// `jl4/examples/legal` and `jl4/examples`, adding the libraries to the domain
// changed NO hold -- the held sets are identical in all three. So this costs
// nothing today; it closes a class for tomorrow. The measurement is not vacuous:
// the libraries contribute 23 files and 438 distinct backticked bindings, and a
// positive control -- a synthetic rename whose target IS one of those bindings --
// goes from 0 held to 1 held when they enter the domain. The instrument was
// shown to be live before its negative answer was believed.

// knowingly reports. Making its findings actionable turns every one of those
// into an edit. MEASURED, in `cleanroom-2026-08/guardianship-of-infants-act.l4`,
// a COMMENT mentioning another file -- "probate-administration-act.l4's `is an
// infant on` writes it `is before`" -- is a filename's genitive, not a field
// reference. The first version took it at face value and renamed `is an infant
// on` across 20+ sites, and that name is not a field at all: it is a top-level

// dereference can yield a TRUNCATED name -- measured in the corpus today,

//   apply renames in sequence, not one pass   2
//   drop the declaration requirement          2
//   drop jl4-core/libraries from the domain   2
//   hazard corpus back to .l4/.md only        1
//   revert realpath in the CLI guard          1
//   drop the `tests/` exclusion               1
//   follow symlinks                           1

// result. A zero says a guard is justified by a comment and exercised by nothing
// -- which is how `IF` and `GIVETH` were found sitting in the binding pattern,
// matching no corpus form and protected by no case. They were removed.
//
// RUN THE MUTANT FROM INSIDE THE REPOSITORY. `REPO` and `LIBRARIES` derive from
// `import.meta.url`, so a copy executed out of /tmp cannot find the libraries and
// reports phantom failures that have nothing to do with the mutation -- six of
// them, at the time of writing. That baseline then MASKS real effects by
// subtraction: measured from /tmp, dropping the libraries from the domain scored
// 0 and looked like an unexercised guard; measured from `etc/`, it scores 2.

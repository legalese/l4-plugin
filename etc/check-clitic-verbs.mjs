// check-clitic-verbs — flag a genitive dereference onto a field whose name
// starts with the verb the clitic already supplied.
//
// THE RULE. `'s` reads as both "is" and "has", so `` person's `is bankrupt` ``
// says the verb twice. The field name must start at the complement:
// `` person's `bankrupt` ``. The ruling is recorded twice already --
// `doc/concepts/language-design/linguistic-syntax.md` under "The Saxon
// Genitive", and `skills/writing-l4-rules/references/drafting-patterns.md`
// under the same heading -- and both say WHY it is not tidiness: the field name
// is what a ladder diagram prints beside its node and what a generated wizard
// asks the user, so a doubled verb is a stutter in the picture and in the
// question.
//
// WHY A SECOND CHECKER, AND NOT A LINE IN check-retired-terms.mjs. That file
// blanks fenced blocks, inline code spans and link targets BEFORE it searches,
// because its terms are prose words and a page that documents an error message
// has to quote it. Its stripping is the load-bearing half of its design. This
// rule lives ONLY inside code -- exactly the text that file deletes. Adding an
// entry there would have produced a permanently green check over an empty
// string. Opposite polarity, separate file.
//
// WHAT IT SCANS, AND WHY THAT IS SIMPLER THAN IT LOOKS. Every line of every
// `.l4` and `.md`, prose and code alike, with no stripping. The pattern is
// specific enough to be self-limiting: `'s` followed by a backticked name
// starting `is `/`has ` occurs in L4 source, in markdown quoting L4 source, and
// essentially nowhere else. Prose is scanned deliberately rather than
// incidentally -- a comment that names a field is a reference to it, and a
// comment left behind by a rename is a stale claim about the tree, which is the
// failure this repo's CLAUDE.md spends its longest section on. Measured over
// `unstable` @ 75068010 before any repair: 143 findings on 142 lines in 51
// files, 83 distinct field names, and only 7 of the 143 sit on an `.l4` comment
// line -- so scanning prose costs almost nothing and catches the stale-comment
// case for free.
//
// WHAT IS NOT IN SCOPE. Meng's ruling (2026-09-13) names "an attribute or
// computed field". A standalone predicate is not one: `` `is misconduct` ``
// defined at top level and applied as `` `is misconduct` allegation `` reads
// correctly and stays. Such a name reached through a MODULE -- ``Part 1's
// `is misconduct` `` -- matches the pattern by accident, because module
// qualification borrows the same clitic. There were 4 of those at the time of
// writing and they take the marker below.
//
// THE MARKER. A line carrying CLITIC-VERB-OK is exempt, and is honoured ONLY
// where there was something to suppress, so it cannot quietly become
// decoration. Every use is printed, so they stay countable. Two things earn it:
// a module-qualified predicate as above, and a deliberate negative example --
// Meng's ruling exempts the wrong form shown AS the wrong form, which is how
// the rule gets taught at all.

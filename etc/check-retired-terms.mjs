// check-retired-terms — flag words we coined, then retired, still standing in
// user-facing prose.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. L4's user-facing text is written for a non-technical
// first-time critical thinker. A few words fail that test not because they are
// hard but because they are OURS: we invented them, wrote them into pages, then
// ruled them out. Those are different from merely-discouraged jargon, and they
// are what this file is for -- for a retired term, ANY occurrence in prose is
// suspect, so a plain search is a sound check. For a merely discouraged word it
// is not, and that difference is the whole design. Measured over ALL of `doc/`
// with the stripping below, on this branch's base (`props/discharge` @ 3625b533,
// before the repairs that ship with this file): `binder` 9 lines,
// `parameter` 140 across 49 files. A list that admitted the second word could
// only ever be advisory; this one can gate CI. (That measurement predates the
// scoping below, which narrows what CI sweeps but not what makes a term
// listable.)
//
// It is not hypothetical, and note the order of events. The ruling is from
// 2026-09-04. The DAY AFTER, `doc/reference/syntax/section-given.md` had the word
// removed by one pull request and put back five times by another, while everyone
// involved believed the ruling was being followed. So the thing this file guards
// against is not an unclear rule -- it is a clear one silently not being held,
// which is the one failure a better-worded rule cannot fix. Nothing caught it:
// `doc/test-docs.sh` checks links and type-checks `.l4` files and has no opinion
// about words.
//
// SCOPE, AND AN HONEST GAP IN IT. Meng ruled on 2026-09-05 that the list binds the
// LEARNING-oriented quadrants and not the rest: retired words are excluded from
// tutorials and the cookbook, and allowed in a Diataxis-style reference or concepts
// page IFF the page introduces the term properly. CI therefore runs
// `--dir doc/tutorials doc/courses`, NOT `--dir doc`.
//
// Which means: the regression that motivated this file, five reintroductions in
// `doc/reference/syntax/section-given.md`, is in a directory this sweep no longer
// visits. Those five were still wrong -- they used the word bare, with no
// introduction -- but wrong under the "iff introduced" half of the ruling, which is
// NOT YET ENFORCED MECHANICALLY. Do not read a green run as cover for a reference
// page. See CLAUDE.md section 7.
//
// The list is also narrower than the ruling's subject matter: the entry matches
// `binder`, and deliberately not `binding`. "Symbol binding" is the PLT phrase the
// ruling is about, but "a binding contract" is ordinary legal English and appears
// throughout the corpus. Only the coined noun was retired.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT FLAG, AND WHY THAT IS THE LOAD-BEARING PART. A page that
// documents an error message has to QUOTE it, and a page that teaches a
// construct has to SHOW it. So fenced blocks, inline code spans and link
// targets are blanked before the search. On the same base, this scan reported
// 17 lines under `doc/` naive and 9 after stripping. The 8 it drops are quoted
// compiler output and code -- every one a false positive, and together enough
// to have made the check unrunnable on its first day.
//
// ADDING A TERM. Every entry cites the ruling that retired it, by date and by
// document. That citation is the anti-rot mechanism, and it is strict on
// purpose: an entry added because someone dislikes a word, with no ruling
// behind it, fails review. A term belongs here only if we coined it AND
// retired it. `discharge` and `assumed term` are current, in-use terms, not
// retired ones. `read-set`, `elaboration` and `section binder` have no
// retiring ruling to cite. So the list has one element, and one element earns
// its keep: it has a five-instance regression against it from inside a day.

// The negative control lives here rather than in a committed fixture file: a
// page full of deliberately-retired words would fail the very sweep it exists
// to validate. Each case below is a bug this file either had or would have had
// -- in particular every stripping rule has a case, because a selftest that has
// never been seen to fail is worth nothing.
//
// It has been seen to fail. Measured, by deleting one rule at a time from a
// scratch copy: the single-backtick line in `stripNoise` reddens 2 cases, the
// link-target line 1, and the fence block in `scanText` 4. The first of those
// numbers was 1 until the code-span case was rewritten -- its original text
// (`SuspiciousBinderPattern`) has no word boundary before the term, so it
// passed with the stripping removed and was testing nothing.

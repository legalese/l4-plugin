# These are P3 HOUSE RULES, not corpus facts, so the same checks apply to
# whichever module set the driver resolved (2026-08-09): the committed
# encoding, or an additional encoding a run selected with `--encoding <id>`.
# The ACCEPTANCE half of P3 — "the deposit exists and the compiler accepts it"
# — is etc/go/phases/p3-encode.sh; the two stages deliberately layer.
#
# Two of P3's house rules are mechanically checkable and are checked here:
# BRANCH-over-ELSE-IF, and an @ref FR citation on every dated arm. The third —
# "isomorphic, reviewable section by section against the regulation" — is not
# checkable in principle, and it is RECORDED as unverified rather than omitted.

# The module set of the encoding THIS RUN IS ABOUT, resolved by the driver as
# GO_MODULES. There is no origin sentinel beside it any more: subject.mjs
# resolves the SELECTED encoding into the ordinary GO_S_ENCODING_MODULES and
# GO_S_MIN_* names, so this stage reads the encoding it was handed and never
# asks which one it is. When invoked directly without GO_MODULES — the
# documented direct-invocation route — the committed encoding's set is the
# default, preserving the pre-2026-08-09 contract. Kept byte-for-byte in step
# with the driver's own derivation (go.sh): a fallback that resolved a NARROWER
# set than a run does would make a direct invocation measure something other

# P3 requires an @ref FR citation on every dated arm. The checkable shape, made
# precise so it does not fire on prose or on test directives:
#
#   a DATED ARM is a line that compares `RULES EFFECTIVE DATE` against a `Date`
#   LITERAL, is not a comment, and is not an `EVAL UNDER RULES EFFECTIVE AT`
#   test directive (those are #EVAL scaffolding, not rule text).
#
#   its @ref must appear in the SAME contiguous run of non-blank lines. That is
#   the declaration's own block, which is where the corpus in fact puts it — a
#   fixed n-line window gets this wrong in both directions.
#
# An earlier version of this check used a 3-line window and reported 20 false
# findings, including comment prose and every #EVAL line. A check that cries
# wolf is worse than no check, so it is stated precisely or not at all.
#
# Negative control, run 2026-08-02 on the inaugural subject: deleting one
# `@ref` makes the check report both arms of the declaration that lost it.
# The subject's NOTES.md records the exact site. It is capable of red.

# "every dated arm carries an @ref" is satisfied VACUOUSLY by an empty matched
# set, and the matcher is a single-physical-line regex: it requires
# `RULES EFFECTIVE DATE` and a `Date <digit>` literal on the SAME line. Reflow
# the two arms so the literal sits on the next line — by hand, or by any future
# formatter width change; `l4 format` preserves the split rather than repairing
# it — and armCount goes to 0 while the check prints a green
# "all 0 dated arm(s) carry an @ref". Measured 2026-08-02 on a copy of the
# corpus with every `@ref` deleted and the two arms reflowed: UNREFD empty,
# armCount 0, `l4 check` still exit 0.
#
# So a zero, or a drop below the known population, is a finding about the
# MATCHER and is reported as one. The floor is the subject's own measured
# dated-arm count for THIS ENCODING's module set (D2, 2026-08-09: floors
# travel with their encoding — subject.json checks.min_dated_arms for the
# committed one, encodings.<id>.checks.min_dated_arms for an additional one,
# and the resolver hands whichever the run selected down as

# of 0 is exactly the vacuous pass this floor exists to prevent, so it prints
# NOT CHECKED with the reason on the receipt instead of "all 0 dated arm(s)
# carry an @ref". Measured on regcf's `cleanroom-2026-08` encoding
# (2026-08-09): the module IS temporally parameterised (8 decisions read the
# rule date, per the DMN exporter's D-RULEDATE advisory) but routes every arm
# through a helper abstraction over YMD constants, which this line-shaped

# AFTER (Opening Edge of the Window)

_After the order is delivered, the customer may place a new order after a three-day cooling-off period, within 30 days._ That sentence has a window with two edges: it **opens** three days after delivery and **closes** thirty days after that. `WITHIN` gives a window its closing edge; `AFTER` gives it its opening edge.

```l4
PARTY Buyer MUST order
AFTER  3
WITHIN 30
```

**Example file:** [after-example.l4](after-example.l4) — the rules on this page, each with a trace showing the instants its window produces.

## The two readings, and why the bare form re-anchors

English writes windows in two shapes, and they are not the same window.

- **Re-anchored:** _after a three-day cooling-off period, within 30 days_ — an offset, then a length measured from where the offset ends. Delivery at 10 gives the window **[13, 43]**.
- **Two-offset:** _not less than 3 nor more than 30 days after delivery_ — two offsets from one anchor. Delivery at 10 gives the window **[13, 40]**.

The bare form, `AFTER 3 WITHIN 30`, is the **re-anchored** window: the `WITHIN` counts from the instant the window opened. It is the reading the cooling-off sentence has, the one the contract calculus this evaluator follows gives it, and the one a process modeller draws by default (a timer starts when the task is reached). It is also the reading that cannot go wrong: opening at 3 and staying open for 30 after that can never be an empty window.

The two-offset window is written with an explicit anchor on the closing edge:

```l4
PARTY Buyer MUST order
AFTER  3
WITHIN 30 OF THE JOIN        -- [delivery+3, delivery+30]
```

`OF THE JOIN` is the anchor vocabulary of [WITHIN](README.md#within-temporal-deadline): the instant the enclosing obligation's `HENCE` fired — here, the delivery. Any anchor `WITHIN` accepts works on the closing edge, and on the opening edge too: `AFTER 3 OF THE JOIN WITHIN 30` opens three after the delivery and, with the `WITHIN` bare, still re-anchors ([13, 43]); `AFTER 3 OF THE ARMING WITHIN 30 OF THE JOIN` measures the two edges from two different instants.

A two-offset window can close before it opens. `AFTER 30 WITHIN 5 OF THE JOIN` is refused by the type checker when both offsets are literals; when they are computed, the run reports it beside the result and the obligation runs as written — every act is early or late, and an early act's note says the window closes before it opens, since it never will be open.

The checker refuses only what it can see is empty. A bare `AFTER` counts from the obligation's own clock — the join under a `HENCE`, the failure time under a `LEST`, the arming at top level — which is not necessarily what the `WITHIN` names: `AFTER 3 WITHIN 2 OF THE DEADLINE` under a `HENCE` is `[join+3, deadline+2]`, two origins, and is open. So the checker compares a bare `AFTER`'s literal against the `WITHIN`'s anchor only where the clock can never precede that anchor — `OF THE ARMING` anywhere, `OF THE JOIN` under `HENCE`, `OF THE DEADLINE` under a `LEST` other than a `SHANT`'s (a `MUST`'s, `DO`'s or `MAY`'s, whose failure time is the missed deadline) — and against an anchor the `AFTER` names itself only when both name the same one. Where an obligation is written is where the checker reads its clock, so it compares the `JOIN` and `DEADLINE` cases only for an obligation that _is_ the continuation it sits in: one passed to a function as an argument, or defined in a `WHERE`, is a value that may be attached under some other obligation's `LEST`, and for it the checker compares nothing but `OF THE ARMING`. Everything else runs, and the run's note says which shape it found empty.

A negative offset is accepted and opens the window before the obligation exists: `AFTER -3 WITHIN 30` under a `HENCE` with the join at 10 is `[7, 37]` — for any event the obligation can see, the same as `AFTER 0 WITHIN 27`. Nothing refuses it; write it only if you mean it.

## An early act is a nullity, and the run says so

An act before the window opens **does not count**. It is not performance, and it is not a breach: the obligation stays live, its deadline is what it was, and the party may act again once the window is open. What the machine adds is a report. A silent nullity is how a party loses a deadline it believed it had met, so the run prints a note beside the result:

```
PARTY Buyer MUST order AFTER 1 WITHIN 30 HENCE FULFILLED
NOTE: PARTY Buyer did order at 12, before the window opened at 13: the act does not count as performance. The obligation stays live, with its deadline untouched (the window closes at 43), and may be performed once the window is open. (EVERY-EACH-QUANTIFIER-SPEC section 5.1.2, R-X6.)
```

That is the binary's output, one line, the closing citation included. The residual printed above it is the window as it stands at instant 12: it opens in 1 and runs 30 from there. The residual is re-measured from each event the obligation looks at: while the window is still to open it prints as `AFTER n WITHIN d` with the time to the opening; from the first event after the window has opened it prints as a plain `WITHIN` with the time remaining, as an anchored deadline's does. Until the obligation has looked at an event it prints as written — so a window already open when the obligation is entered (a negative or zero `AFTER`) still shows its `AFTER` until the first event, and `AFTER -3 WITHIN 30` entered at 10 prints `WITHIN 17` after an event at 20.

The note travels with the result on every surface this evaluator renders to: the golden and `l4 run` text (a `NOTE:` line, a `Notes:` section), `l4 run --json` and `l4 batch --json` (a `"notes"` array on the directive, present only when there is something to report), the editor's diagnostic and inspector, and the REPL. A note is said once per directive — the same sentence, with the same instants, is not repeated, and the sentence is the whole key: two obligations that print the same sentence (the two arms of a `RAND` with one party, act and window, say) share one note, and so do two acts at one instant. The note tells you the fact, not how many times it happened. The one surface that does **not** carry it is the decision service (`jl4-service`), whose response schema has no place for it yet; a client of that service sees only the residual. That gap is recorded as owed.

For a prohibition the early act is likewise not a violation — the prohibition has not started — and the note says so. `PARTY Buyer SHANT smoke AFTER 3 WITHIN 30` forbids smoking from 3 to 33: smoking at 2 is reported and ignored, smoking at 5 is the violation, and a prohibition kept through 33 is fulfilled.

## AFTER alone

An `AFTER` with no closing edge is a window that opens and never closes — a right that vests and does not expire.

```l4
PARTY Buyer MAY order AFTER 3
```

An act at 1000 is in time. Before the window opens the residual prints `AFTER n`; after it, the permission prints with no window at all. An early act here is reported with "no closing edge" in place of the deadline clause, there being no deadline to leave untouched.

## Under LEST, and under a join

Under a `LEST` the clock is the **failure time** (see [LEST](README.md#lest-breach-consequence)): for a `MUST`, `DO` or `MAY` that is the deadline it missed, so `AFTER 3 WITHIN 30` there opens three after that deadline and closes thirty after that — `[deadline+3, deadline+33]` — and `AFTER 3 OF THE DEADLINE WITHIN 30` names the same instant. For a `SHANT` the failure time is the violating act's own stamp, which comes before the prohibition's window ends: there the bare `AFTER 3 WITHIN 30` counts from the violation, while `OF THE DEADLINE` names the window's end, and the two windows differ. In the `HENCE` of a barrier (`ONCE ALL HAVE`) it counts from the last member's act; on the members' own line it counts from the `EVERY`'s arming, for each member. A join line's own `WITHIN` bounds the whole and is not re-anchored by a member's `AFTER`: with `AFTER 3` on the act and `WITHIN 30` on the join line, each member's window is `[3, 30]` from the arming. The join line takes no `AFTER` of its own. See [EVERY](EVERY.md#what-runs-today-and-what-does-not).

## The absolute forms: AFTER date, BEFORE date

Each edge also has an absolute form. `AFTER` takes a date as well as a duration — the type says which — and the closing edge's absolute form has its own word, `BEFORE`:

```l4
PARTY Buyer MUST pay 100
AFTER  3
BEFORE (YMD 2026 6 30)       -- opens three days after arming, closes on 30 June
```

`WITHIN` takes a duration and `BEFORE` takes a date, as in English — _within 30 days_, _before 30 June_, never _within 30 June_ — and each refuses the other's argument by naming the other word. `AFTER (YMD 2026 6 10) WITHIN 5` opens on 10 June and runs five days from there. A date already names an instant, so `AFTER date` takes no `OF` anchor. `BEFORE` is accepted on the act only; on a join line write `WITHIN 0 OF date`.

**The limit.** A date is lowered to its serial (what `DATE_SERIAL` computes), which lands on the trace's clock only when the trace is stamped in date serials — start it `AT (DATE_SERIAL (YMD 2026 6 1))` and stamp its events the same way (`IMPORT daydate` for `YMD`). Nothing yet declares, at the contract level, which scale a contract's clock is on; until it does, the machine refuses to lower a date onto a clock that no calendar date has a serial for — an obligation entered when the clock read less than `DATE_SERIAL (YMD 1 1 1)`, which is 365, i.e. every trace that starts `AT 0` — and says so by name, instead of counting from a serial in the hundreds of thousands. A floating trace that happens to start at 365 or above is not caught: that is the one sentence this page owes you. The same refusal now protects `WITHIN d OF date`.

## Order

The opening edge is written before the closing edge — `AFTER 3 WITHIN 30`, `AFTER 3 BEFORE date` — and a deonton has one of each. `WITHIN 30 AFTER 3` is a parse error that says so. (The two orders do not mean two different windows; that idea was considered and rejected, because word order is the wrong place to carry a meaning an anchor already carries.)

## What the exports do with it

- The natural-language annotation reads the bare window aloud as `after 3 within 30 of that`.
- The document export prints the window as one phrase with its own prepositions: `after 3, within 30 of that`; a `BEFORE` date is printed as its expression — `before YMD with 2026, 6 and 30` for `BEFORE (YMD 2026 6 30)`, `before 30 June 2026` for `BEFORE (Date 30 6 2026)`, whose constructor the export knows how to read aloud.
- The BPMN export does not draw an opening edge — a BPMN task is enabled as soon as it is reached — and its fidelity report says so on the task (`P-WINDOW-OPENING`, blocking). The same note says what the opening does to the closing edge, which depends on the closing edge's shape: beside a bare `WITHIN`, which re-anchors, the boundary timer runs from the task's start and so is measured from the wrong point; an anchored `WITHIN`, a `BEFORE` date and a join line's `WITHIN` demoted to the member do not re-anchor, and the note says the timer, where one is drawn, is measured from the right point. A `BEFORE` date is carried onto the boundary event verbatim as a condition, not as a timer, and its documentation string reads _not discharged BEFORE …_.
- The MLIR/WASM export fails closed on any obligation with an `AFTER`, as it already does on an anchored `WITHIN`.

## What `l4 lts` shows

[`l4 lts`](lts-list.md) lists an obligation whose window has yet to open with the deadline the window actually closes on — `Buyer MUST order — due by 43 (31 from now; the window opens at 13)` after the early act at 12 in the first trace of `after-example.l4` — and files that early act under _What the contract would pass over_: "the window has not opened yet (it opens at 13; an act before then counts for nothing)". With `--steps` the early act's look is in the history like any other, worded "the act came before the window opens at 13; it counts for nothing and is passed over". The golden `jl4/examples/lts/expected/after-example.txt` is the whole listing of this page's example file. Two limits: the list tries the act _now_, which before the opening is always too early — it does not try the act at the opening — and an `AFTER date` is not worked out by the list before the contract has looked at an event, so until then such an obligation is named as one whose deadline is not known there (after an event it is dated like any other).

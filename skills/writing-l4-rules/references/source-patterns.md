# From the words on the page to L4: a phrasebook

Keyed on **what the source text says**. [drafting-patterns.md](drafting-patterns.md) is keyed on the
L4 shape — reach for that one when you know which shape you want; reach for this one when you are
looking at a sentence of statute or contract and do not.

Each entry has five parts:

- **If the source says** — the drafting phrase, with a real quotation from the encoded corpus in
  this repository and its file and line.
- **It is doing** — the legal job the phrase performs, in a sentence or two. Most encoding mistakes
  are here, not in the syntax: the same word (`means`, `refuses`, `prescribed`) does two different
  jobs in two different places.
- **Write** — the L4 pattern. Every snippet on this page was run before it went in.
- **Not** — the shape a model reaches for first, and why it is wrong.
- **See** — where the shape is treated at length.

**How this phrasebook is laid out.** The entries live in eleven area files under
[source-patterns/](source-patterns/), one file per area, and this page is the index: each area
below links to its file and lists **every** entry in it. Entries are numbered _area_._entry_, so 4.3
is the third entry of area 4, and each one has a stable anchor of the form `#e4-3`. **Area 11, when
the encoding cannot answer, is sequestered last on purpose** — `REFUSE` is obscure enough that you
could encode a dozen laws or contracts and never use it, so it is kept out of the way of the ten
areas you will use every day. An entry's title quotes the drafting phrase itself, so a contract's
**"WHEREAS"** and a statute's "unless the context otherwise requires" appear below in the source's
own words rather than under an L4 name.

**This index is generated from the area files, and it is complete.** An earlier version of it listed
25 of the entries that existed and marked three areas "entries to come" when those areas were fully
written; a trial encoder navigating from it skipped the three areas the contract in front of them
most needed. If you add an entry to an area file, add its line here in the same change.

## What is new, and what is not here yet

**New in this release.**

- The **section `GIVEN`** — a `GIVEN` indented under a `§` heading, declaring an input that every
  rule in that section reads without re-declaring it. A `GIVEN` at column 1 is unchanged: it is the
  signature of the one declaration below it, a **rule `GIVEN`**. Indentation is the whole
  difference.
- **`REFUSE "message"`** — an expression at any type that stops the evaluation and says why. Nothing
  downstream can catch it; only the boundary (the directive, the command line, the application
  programming interface, the web form) sees it. That guarantee is about a refusal something
  **forces**: evaluation is lazy, so a refusal you store inside a value instead of returning may
  never run at all, and the caller gets an ordinary answer.
  [Entry 11.8](source-patterns/11-when-the-encoding-cannot-answer.md#e11-8) measures both halves.
  `TBD`, from the prelude, is the refusal that means "not written yet".
- **`ASSUME` is deprecated for declaring inputs, and still works.** It parses, type-checks and
  exports exactly as before, and since 2026-09-07 draws a deprecation warning naming the
  spelling to use instead. Write new inputs as a record parameter or a section `GIVEN`; see
  [entry 11.7](source-patterns/11-when-the-encoding-cannot-answer.md#e11-7) for migrating an old one.

**Proposed, not landed (2026-09-04). Do not write these.**

- Supplying a **section `GIVEN`** or an `ASSUME`d name from inside the file, at a directive or at
  a call in a body: `` #EVAL f WITH `the reading` IS `the strict reading` ``.
  What `WITH` can name today is a rule's **own** inputs, so `#EVAL f WITH x IS 25` works where
  `f` is `GIVEN x …`; naming anything that is not one of the rule's own inputs is a check error,
  not a parse error (the rule's real inputs are reported unsupplied, and the name you wrote is
  reported undefined). A parse error, `unexpected WITH`, is what you get only when a positional
  value precedes the `WITH`, as in ``#EVAL `tax on` 100 WITH rate IS 0.2``. Section-`GIVEN`
  values are supplied from outside: a web form, `l4 batch FILE --inputs cases.json`, or the
  service request.
- Discharge — the compiler working out which inputs an entry point actually reads and asking for
  exactly those.
- `TYPICALLY` as a default the caller may omit. Today it is metadata: the input is still required.
- A dedicated `SUBJECT TO` / `NOTWITHSTANDING` construct. **Neither is a keyword** — there is no
  token for either in the lexer.
  [Entry 2.2](source-patterns/02-conditions-and-logic.md#e2-2) says what to write instead.
- Per-backend handling of a refusal in the export targets.

## The distinction that decides half of these entries

> **"The law does not apply, or is not in force" is the law's own answer, and stays an ordinary
> value or gate. "The model does not cover this" is the encoder's answer, and is a refusal.**

The first is determinate, and the law provides for it: savings and transitional provisions reach
back into exactly that period, so something must be there for them to reach. The second is a
recusal — the encoder declines, no party may read the decline as a decision in their favour, and the
matter goes to another bench. A refusal is unreachable by construction, so **if you find yourself
wanting a savings provision to reach past a `REFUSE`, the `REFUSE` was wrong.**

**Numbering.** These entries were one flat run of 25 until 2026-09-04, when they became eleven
areas. Every cross-reference inside the phrasebook, in `SKILL.md` and in `regulative.md` now names
the new _area_._entry_ number; the old-to-new table that stood here has been removed because nothing
uses it any more. If you meet an "entry 17" anywhere, it predates the split and the mapping is in
`scratchpad/docs/cookbook-map.md`.

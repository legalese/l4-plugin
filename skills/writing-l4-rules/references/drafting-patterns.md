# L4 Drafting Patterns — Idioms from Formalizing Statute

Hard-won idioms from formalizing 43 statutory grounds for possession (UK Housing Act 1988, Schedule 2,
as amended by the Renters' Rights Act 2025). Each pattern is **"when the statute says…" → the L4 shape →
a real example file**. Pair with [regulative.md](regulative.md) (the deontic outcome) and
[state-ledger.md](state-ledger.md) (recording facts over the trace). Cited example paths are basenames under
the housing-act corpus (`…/jl4/experiments/housing-act-<name>.l4`); where a pattern is drawn from another
corpus, the path is given in full from the repo root.

A cross-cutting surface note: across the constitutive limbs below, **`...` is AND-sugar and `..` is OR-sugar**
(asyndetic con/disjunction; see the "Asyndetic operators `...` and `..`" section of
[gotchas.md](gotchas.md)). A string literal in boolean context is **inert** — it carries the verbatim
statutory prose but evaluates to the identity of its context (`TRUE` under `AND`, `FALSE` under `OR`), so it
never changes the result. A limb that reads `NOT P .. Q` _is_ `(NOT P) OR Q` — the `..` is the OR, with the
verbatim statutory prose riding inert between the operands.

---

## Constitutive limbs (the predicate tree)

### Conditional / proviso limb — `(NOT X) OR Y`

**Statute:** "if X, then Y" — a limb that only _bites_ when its antecedent X holds.
**Shape:** material implication `(NOT X) OR Y`, vacuously satisfied (TRUE) when X is false.

Spelled-out form (`ground-4.l4`, limb (c), succession notice):

```l4
`(c) — succession notice condition` claim MEANS
        "(c) if the tenancy arose by succession as mentioned in section 39(5), notice was given ..."
    ...     NOT claim's `tenancy arose by succession as mentioned in section 39(5)`
        OR  claim's `notice given to previous tenant under Case 14 of Sch.15 Rent Act 1977`
```

OR-sugar form, where the prose interleaves the two operands (`ground-13.l4` / `ground-15.l4`, the
lodger-or-sub-tenant removal proviso):

```l4
`lodger or sub-tenant removal proviso` claim MEANS
        "and, in the case of an act of waste by ... a person lodging with the tenant or a sub-tenant of his,"
    ..  NOT claim's `the responsible actor is a person lodging with the tenant or a sub-tenant of his`
    ..  "the tenant has not taken such steps as he ought reasonably to have taken for the removal ..."
    ..  claim's `the tenant has not taken such steps as he ought reasonably to have taken for the removal of the lodger or sub-tenant`
```

The `ground-4.l4` (explicit `OR`) vs `ground-13/15.l4` (`..`) pair is a clean before/after of the two surface
forms for the _same_ `(NOT P) OR Q` logic.

### Negative limb — `NOT atom`, and the negated disjunction

**Statute:** "the tenancy is **not** an assured agricultural occupancy"; or "**not** granted via any of (i)/(ii)/(iii)".
**Shape:** a single positive atom wrapped in `NOT` for the simple case; a **negated disjunction**
`NOT (i OR ii OR iii)` (De Morgan) for "not via any of …".

Simple (`ground-4.l4`, limb (d)):

```l4
`(d) — not an assured agricultural occupancy` claim MEANS
        "(d) the tenancy is not an assured agricultural occupancy ... by virtue of paragraph 3 of Schedule 3."
    ... NOT claim's `tenancy is an assured agricultural occupancy (agric. worker condition fulfilled, Sch.3 para.3)`
```

Negated disjunction (`ground-5H.l4`, limb (e)) — build the three routes as one named disjunction, then negate
it (more readable than `NOT(i) AND NOT(ii) AND NOT(iii)`, and keeps each route with its verbatim text):

```l4
`tenancy was granted via an excluded route` claim MEANS
        "(i) pursuant to a nomination as mentioned in section 159(2)(c) of the Housing Act 1996,"
    ..  claim's `tenancy was granted pursuant to a nomination under s.159(2)(c) Housing Act 1996`
    ..  "(ii) as a tenancy of supported accommodation, or"
    ..  claim's `tenancy was granted as a tenancy of supported accommodation`
    ..  "(iii) in pursuance of a local housing authority's duty under section 193 ..."
    ..  claim's `tenancy was granted in pursuance of a local housing authority's s.193 duty`

`(e) — tenancy was not granted via an excluded route` claim MEANS
        "(e) the tenancy was not granted—"
    ... NOT `tenancy was granted via an excluded route` claim
```

### "Only in a case where X applies" gate — `(NOT gate) OR condition`

**Statute:** "the … condition, **but only in a case where** section 7(5ZA) applies".
**Shape:** an implication `(NOT gate) OR condition` — vacuous (TRUE) when the gate is off; the gate is itself a
named predicate (possibly a conjunction). Same machinery as the proviso limb, but the antecedent is a
jurisdictional gate rather than a fact.

`ground-6.l4`, limbs (b) and (c):

```l4
`(b) landlord's acquisition condition, only where s.7(5ZA) applies` claim MEANS
        "(b) the landlord's acquisition condition, but only in a case where section 7(5ZA) applies ..."
    ..  NOT `section 7(5ZA) case applies` claim
    ..  `landlord's acquisition condition` claim

`(c) additional RSL condition, only where landlord is RSL and redeveloper` claim MEANS
        "(c) the additional RSL condition, but only in a case where the landlord seeking possession is— ..."
    ..  NOT `additional-RSL case applies` claim     -- gate is itself (i) AND (ii)
    ..  `additional RSL condition` claim
```

### Enumerated cases (Case A / B / C) — a disjunction of predicates

**Statute:** "is a qualifying X **in case A or B**" / "met **in case A, case B or case C**".
**Shape:** an OR over named per-case predicates; each Case is its own `GIVEN claim … MEANS` predicate, so the
disjunction reads like the statute.

`ground-5A.l4` (qualifying agricultural worker) / `ground-6.l4` (additional RSL condition):

```l4
`is a qualifying agricultural worker` claim MEANS
        "For the purpose of this ground a person is a \"qualifying agricultural worker\" in case A or B."
    ..  `Case A` claim
    ..  `Case B` claim
```

### Checkbox relation-on-an-entity — independent BOOLEAN flags + a disjunction

**Statute:** a kinship / category list — "(a) the landlord; (b) the landlord's spouse …; (c) the landlord's
parent/grandparent/sibling/child/grandchild; (d) …".
**Shape:** independent BOOLEAN flags on the entity record + a disjunction over them — **not an enum**. This is
input-layer-friendly (each limb is a checkbox, not a mutually-exclusive radio button), and you include one
catch-all "other" flag that is **deliberately omitted from the disjunction** so an off-list occupier yields
FALSE.

`ground-1-amended-2025.l4` (family occupier (a)–(d)):

```l4
DECLARE Occupier HAS
    name                                                  IS A STRING
    `is the landlord`                                     IS A BOOLEAN   -- (a)
    `is the landlord's spouse, civil partner or cohabitant`  IS A BOOLEAN -- (b)
    `is the landlord's parent`                            IS A BOOLEAN   -- (c)(i)
    -- ... grandparent / sibling / child / grandchild ...
    `is a child or grandchild of the landlord's partner`  IS A BOOLEAN   -- (d)
    `is other`                                            IS A BOOLEAN   -- none of (a)-(d); NOT in the disjunction

`is a qualifying occupier` occupier MEANS
        "(a) the landlord;"                  ... occupier's `is the landlord`
    ..  "(b) the landlord's spouse ..."      ... occupier's `is the landlord's spouse, civil partner or cohabitant`
    ..  "(c) the landlord's— (i) parent;"    ... occupier's `is the landlord's parent`
    ..  -- ... limbs (ii)-(v) ...
    ..  "(d) a child or grandchild ..."      ... occupier's `is a child or grandchild of the landlord's partner`
    -- `is other` is deliberately NOT a disjunct: an off-list occupier is FALSE.
```

### Statutory tables as DATA — a record per row + enums + membership via `any`

**Statute:** a table (e.g. landlord-type × tenancy-type × redeveloper).
**Shape:** an enum per column's cell-type, a `TableRow` record (cells, with list-valued cells as `LIST OF` the
enum), one `… WITH …` literal per row, and membership tested structurally with `any` + a local equality
predicate.

`ground-6.l4`:

```l4
DECLARE RedeveloperType IS ONE OF `the landlord who is seeking possession`, `a superior landlord`, `the commonhold association`
DECLARE LandlordColumnType IS ONE OF `col1 a relevant social landlord`, ...
DECLARE TableRow HAS
    `first column — landlord seeking possession`       IS A LandlordColumnType
    `second column — tenancy`                          IS A TenancyColumnType
    `third column — landlords intending to redevelop`  IS A LIST OF RedeveloperType

`redeveloper is in the third column of the row` MEANS
    any (`equals the redeveloper`) (`row`'s `third column — landlords intending to redevelop`)
    WHERE
        `equals the redeveloper` x MEANS x EQUALS `redeveloper`
```

---

## Decision results (the return type)

### Total enum over `MAYBE` — where the source names the absent case

**The rule, in two sentences.** `MAYBE` inbound, for a fact you may not have been given; a **total
enum** outbound, for a result you always have. Where the source itself names the absent outcome —
"no issuance", "no liability", "the application is refused" — that name belongs in the result type
as a member, not folded into `NOTHING`.

**Statute:** a provision whose outcomes include a named "nothing follows" case.
**Shape:** one nullary `IS ONE OF` covering _every_ outcome, the absent one included, returned as
`GIVETH A <Enum>` — **not** `GIVETH A MAYBE <Enum>`.

`jl4/examples/legal/ny-environmental-7.3.l4` (6 NYCRR 624 §7.3(b)(2), issuance of the final EIS)
already does this, and does it while keeping `MAYBE` exactly where `MAYBE` belongs:

```l4
DECLARE `Final EIS Issuance` IS ONE OF
    `No issuance`                                           -- the absent case, NAMED
    `Issued within 45 days of the close of the record`
    `Issued extended beyond 45 days of the close of the record`

GIVEN `The decision`        IS A `Tentative or recommended decision`
      `Cause for extension` IS A MAYBE `Final EIS Issuance Extension Cause`   -- input: stays MAYBE
GIVETH A `Final EIS Issuance`                                                 -- result: total
`Determining issuance for final EIS` MEANS
    IF    NOT `Tentative or recommended decision will contain a final EIS` `The decision`
    THEN  `No issuance`
    ELSE  CONSIDER `Cause for extension`
              WHEN NOTHING    THEN `Issued within 45 days of the close of the record`
              WHEN JUST cause THEN `Issued extended beyond 45 days of the close of the record`
```

The asymmetry _is_ the rule, and it fits in one function. The surviving `MAYBE` on
`Cause for extension` is correct and must not be swept up.

**Why, in the terms you can check from here.** Legislation usually _names_ the null outcome rather
than leaving a gap, and the name carries the citation. `NOTHING` cannot hold `"No issuance"`; an
enum member can, and it reads back in the statute's own words. Under `MAYBE` the declared domain
also silently shrinks — the enum above would go from three outcomes to two.

**And the fold is not always a rename.** The four real-corpus occurrences —
`the entity's/person's liability under Article 21/23` in
`paper/case-studies/charities-jersey-2014/part-6-use-of-terms.l4` — return
`MAYBE Part6Penalty`, and `Part6Penalty` is a four-field **RECORD**, not a nullary enum. Its fields
are load-bearing: `is the same penalty as` and `is a heavier penalty than` read them, and they feed
the file's flagship assertion,
`` #ASSERT `the penalty tracks the mens rea, not the paragraph number` ``.
Flattening the penalties into nullary enum members would delete that assertion's subject matter.
The available fold is a **sentinel record** — add a fifth constant (`the absence of a penalty`,
imprisonment `0`, `liable to a fine IS FALSE`) and return `GIVETH A Part6Penalty` — which costs 4
signatures, 4 `ELSE` arms and 12 `#ASSERT` edits (9 lose a `JUST`, 3 lose a `NOTHING`). It is also
a _modelling_ claim: it makes "no offence" and "an offence with a nil penalty" the same value.
Retrofitting a total enum onto a record-valued result is a modelling decision and belongs in
review, not in a tidy-up. This is bucket 5 of the next section, and it is the case the "does the
source name this outcome?" test gets wrong on its own: the statute plainly names the absence, so
that question says fold, and it is still not a tidy-up.

**Scope — a drafting default, not a sweep.** Across the repo there are 62 `GIVETH … MAYBE`
signatures in 17 files, and **only 4 of them are in a real legal corpus**. The rest are
standard-library partiality (`minimum`, `lookup`, `ln`, date parsing), JSON-decode and MLIR
fixtures, and teaching examples — all correct, none touched by this rule. Apply it when drafting a
new decision; do not go hunting.

**For an absent value that is a fact about the case rather than an outcome** — "…, if any", "where
there is no …" — the phrasebook entry that owns it is 11.3,
[source-patterns/11-when-the-encoding-cannot-answer.md](source-patterns/11-when-the-encoding-cannot-answer.md#e11-3).
That is a `MAYBE`, matched with `CONSIDER`, and folding it is a category error.

#### Background, not needed to write L4: what these shapes do in the decision-table export

Nothing below changes what you write. It is here because two further arguments for the total enum
were made from the exporter that writes L4 out as DMN (Decision Model and Notation), whose
expression language is FEEL, and retiring them silently would lose the measurements.

> **Provenance.** These two rest on the DMN/FEEL exporter, which lives on the `mengwong/dmn-export`
> line and is **not** on `unstable`: there is no `jl4-core/src/L4/Dmn/` and `l4 --help` has no `dmn`
> subcommand here. Reported behaviour of another branch, not something to verify in situ. Re-check
> against `specs/todo/DMN-EXPORT-PROGRAM-MODEL-SPEC.md` §2.4 and §3 once that line merges — two
> earlier versions of this passage stated the FEEL null semantics backwards.

- **A finite declared domain.** A nullary `IS ONE OF` is the one L4 type with a faithful image in
  FEEL/DMN, because its values serialise as strings; it lowers to `typeRef="string"`. `MAYBE T` is a
  type _applied to an argument_, so it lowers to `Any` and contributes no declared type. Do not
  over-generalise this to "`GIVETH` is authoritative": it is authoritative only when it lowers to
  something other than `Any`. Emitting the domain as DMN `<outputValues>` is pending
  (smucclaw/l4-ide#923); the `typeRef` difference is present behaviour.
- **No null wrapper in the export target.** `NOTHING` is nullary and survives as the string
  `"NOTHING"`, but `JUST x` is an _applied_ constructor, which the exporter cannot render as
  executable FEEL: it emits it verbatim and reports **Blocking**, because a real engine
  (Drools/KIE 8.44) answers `Unknown variable 'JUST'` and the decision evaluates to **null**,
  reported as `SUCCEEDED`. FEEL's null is not a failure signal — it is coerced to `false` at the
  first boolean consumer (verified in `feelin` 7.0.1: `if null then 1 else 2` → `2`), so nothing
  downstream ever sees an error. Where this bites is a flat guarded chain,
  `IF … THEN JUST X ELSE NOTHING`, which
  `paper/case-studies/charities-jersey-2014/part-6-use-of-terms.l4` emits four times.
- **It does not bite on the worked example above.** `WHEN JUST cause` is a **binding** pattern, and
  a binding arm has no guard the exporter can write down, so the whole `CONSIDER` collapses to a
  single verbatim default entry either way. The second-order lesson — a `CONSIDER` arm that binds a
  payload is itself a DMN-hostile shape — is real, and folding the return type does not fix it.
- **A tagged union buys nothing downstream.** FEEL has no sum type, so
  `` `no liability` | `liable` HAS `the penalty` IS A Part6Penalty `` lowers to `Any` too. That is
  an export-fidelity fact, not a drafting verdict: upstream, in L4 itself, the tagged union is the
  only shape that both names the absent outcome and keeps the payload typed. Not a reason to prefer
  `MAYBE`.

### Where `MAYBE` is right — and it usually is

Guidance that only says "prefer the enum" gets over-applied. The test is **two** questions, asked in
this order:

1. **Does the source name this outcome?** If the absence is _your_ bookkeeping, a fact you were not
   given, or a proof you do not have, it is a `MAYBE` and folding it is a category error.
2. **If the source does name it: does the _present_ outcome carry a payload?** If it does not, fold
   to a nullary `IS ONE OF` — that is the rule at the top of this section. If it does, a nullary
   enum is simply unavailable (there is nowhere to put the `NUMBER`, the `Money`, the `DATE`), and
   the choice is between a sentinel value in the payload type and a tagged union. Both are
   **modelling** decisions; see bucket 5.

Question 1 alone gives the wrong answer for payload-carrying results — it says "fold" for the
Charities penalties, whose absence the statute plainly names, while the paragraph above correctly
says that fold "belongs in review, not in a tidy-up". Five buckets, all with real examples:

Note before the list which of them are even in scope. This section is titled "decision results (the
return type)", and **only buckets 2 and 5 are return positions.** Buckets 1, 3 and 4 are parameters
and record fields — they are here because they are what the rule gets mistakenly applied to, not
because they are cases it decides.

**1. An input you may not have been given** — parameter position. `Cause for extension` in the
worked example above. This is by far the biggest population: 119 `IS A[N] MAYBE` occurrences in
field/parameter position repo-wide, against 62 in return position. The rule does not touch any of
them.

**2. A lookup or a parse that can genuinely miss** — return position, and the one bucket in this
list that is a genuine counter-case to the rule at the top. `lookup` / `dictLookup`
(`jl4-core/libraries/prelude.l4`) is the canonical case — a key that is not there is not an
_outcome_. Likewise `Date` from a `STRING` (`jl4-core/libraries/daydate.l4`), `minimum`/`maximum`
over a possibly-empty list, and the domain-restricted `ln`/`sqrt`/`asin` in
`jl4-core/libraries/math.l4`.

**3. An optional record field** — field position, not a return type.
`jl4/examples/legal/ceo-performance-award.l4`:

```l4
DECLARE `Tranche Status` HAS
    `Tranche Number`        IS A NUMBER
    `Is Earned`             IS A BOOLEAN
    `Earn Date`             IS A MAYBE DATE                 -- unearned tranche has no earn date
    `Vesting Category`      IS A MAYBE `Vesting Category`   -- ... and no category yet
```

`Vesting Category` is a genuine two-member legal taxonomy
(`Seven And Half Year Earned Shares` / `Ten Year Earned Shares`). Inventing a third member
`` `not yet earned` `` to make the field total would pollute the statute's classification with a
bookkeeping state the source never contemplated — the opposite of fidelity.

**4. `MAYBE BOOLEAN` as _undecided_** — the epistemic third state, not an outcome. Note that here
too the `MAYBE` is in **parameter** position; every function in the library returns
`GIVETH A BOOLEAN`. `jl4-core/libraries/negation-as-failure.l4` is built on it:

```l4
-- JUST TRUE   proven true
-- JUST FALSE  proven false
-- NOTHING     no proof either way (the open question / the default)
GIVEN p IS A MAYBE BOOLEAN
GIVETH A BOOLEAN
holds p MEANS fromMaybe FALSE p      -- closed-world: absence of proof is FALSE
```

Here `NOTHING` means "not yet settled", and the closed- vs open-world default (`holds` vs
`presumed`) is the whole point of the library. Folding it into an enum would collapse the
distinction the library exists to draw.

**5. The source names the absent outcome _and_ the present outcome carries a payload** — return
position, and the case question 1 alone gets wrong. `MAYBE Part6Penalty`, `MAYBE Money`,
`MAYBE DATE`: the statute names "no offence" / "no award" / "no deadline", so question 1 says fold,
but a nullary `IS ONE OF` has nowhere to put the penalty, the amount or the date. Three shapes, none
of them a tidy-up:

- **Leave the `MAYBE`.** Honest, costs nothing today, and is what all four Charities occurrences do.
  The default when nobody is asking for the export.
- **A sentinel value in the payload type** — `` `the absence of a penalty` `` with imprisonment `0`.
  Cheapest to write, but it asserts that "no offence" and "an offence with a nil penalty" are the
  same value, which is a claim about the statute. Costed in detail above for Part 6.
- **A tagged union** — `` `no liability` | `liable` HAS `the penalty` IS A Part6Penalty ``. The only
  shape that both names the absence and keeps the payload typed, and the one to reach for when the
  distinction matters. It does not improve the DMN export (FEEL has no sum type), so choose it for
  the L4-side modelling, not for the exporter.

Whichever you pick, it is a **modelling** decision and goes through review.

One more that looks like a decision result but is not: `MAYBE` as a **selection** predicate feeding
`mapMaybe` — `IF pg's snd THEN JUST (pg's fst) ELSE NOTHING`, the `satisfied grounds` idiom under
"Provenance, repeal, aggregation" below. That is a filter, not an outcome.

---

## Dates

### Leap-safe date windows — build from the actual dates, never hardcode 365

**Statute:** "within 12 months" / "at least 1 year", inclusive of both endpoints.
**Shape:** `IMPORT daydate`; build the window endpoint from the actual date's components, incrementing the
**year** (`DATE_YEAR … PLUS 1`), and compare via inclusive day-spans (`(Day b MINUS Day a) PLUS 1`). The
calendar handles leap years; a magic `365` does not.

`ground-1-amended-2025.l4` ("at least 1 year") / `ground-2ZA.l4` ("within 12 months beginning with …"):

```l4
`one year after tenancy start` c MEANS
    Date (DATE_DAY   (c's `tenancy began`))
         (DATE_MONTH (c's `tenancy began`))
         (DATE_YEAR  (c's `tenancy began`) PLUS 1)   -- leap-safe: increment the YEAR
-- inclusive span: (Day (one year after) MINUS Day (tenancy began)) PLUS 1
```

### ⚠️ The `daydate` month-subtraction FOOTGUN

> **`Date day month year` does NOT roll a month `≤ 0` back into the previous year.** > `Date 1 (3 MINUS 6) 2025` clamps to **January 2025**, _not_ September 2024. Month **overflow** past 12 _does_
> roll forward correctly (`month PLUS 6` on a December date lands in the next year).
>
> So to compute "**N months before** X", never subtract months from X. Instead:
>
> - **ADD** N months to the _earlier_ date (`DATE_MONTH earlier PLUS N`) and compare, or
> - go back a whole year via `DATE_YEAR … MINUS 1` (which can never produce `month ≤ 0`, so the clamp never fires).
>
> **`YMD year month day` does NOT inherit this — it refuses instead.** `YMD 2025 (3 MINUS 6) 1` stops on the refusal binding rather than clamping. So this footgun, and the ADD-to-the-earlier-date workaround below, are about `Date` — which remains the right constructor when you _want_ rolling month arithmetic. Use `YMD` for literals.
>
> (Same footgun is catalogued in [gotchas.md](gotchas.md) under "The `daydate` month-subtraction footgun".)

"≤ 6 months before proceedings" done safely by **adding** to the earlier date (`ground-2ZC.l4` / `ground-2ZD.l4`):

```l4
-- proceedings <= became-landlord + 6 months. We ADD to the earlier date rather than
-- subtracting from the later one, because the Date constructor does not roll a
-- month <= 0 back into the previous year.
`became landlord no more than 6 months before proceedings` MEANS
        Day `proceedings commenced date`
    AT MOST Day `six months after became-landlord date`
    WHERE
        `six months after became-landlord date` MEANS
            Date (DATE_DAY   `became-landlord date`)
                 (DATE_MONTH `became-landlord date` PLUS 6)   -- overflow rolls forward, correctly
                 (DATE_YEAR  `became-landlord date`)
```

The clamp-immune way to go _backward_ — decrement the YEAR (`ground-2ZD.l4`, "12 months ending with …"):

```l4
`twelve months before would-have-expired date` MEANS
    Date (DATE_DAY   `would-have-expired date`)
         (DATE_MONTH `would-have-expired date`)
         (DATE_YEAR  `would-have-expired date` MINUS 1)   -- safe: never yields month <= 0
```

## The deontic outcome

### Mandatory vs discretionary — `MUST` vs `MAY` (+ reasonableness)

**Statute:** Part I grounds are **mandatory** ("the court … shall … make an order"); Part II grounds are
**discretionary** ("the court may … if it considers it reasonable").
**Shape:** Part I → `PARTY Court MUST \`order possession\``; Part II → `PARTY Court MAY \`order possession\``(with a reasonableness conjunct). This rides the MUST/MAY default semantics: **MUST** — omission ⇒`BREACH`;
**MAY** — benign omission ⇒ `FULFILLED` (no breach), which is exactly what makes the ground *discretionary*.
The deadline keyword is **`WITHIN <number>` only** (`BEFORE` is not valid). See [regulative.md](regulative.md)
for the full HENCE/LEST default table.

```l4
-- Part I (ground-6.l4): mandatory
`ground 6 possession order` claim MEANS
    IF   `Ground 6 made out` claim
    THEN PARTY Court MUST `order possession` WITHIN 30
    ELSE FULFILLED

-- Part II (ground-9.l4): discretionary
`ground 9 possession order` claim MEANS
    IF   `Ground 9 made out` claim
    THEN PARTY Court MAY `order possession` WITHIN 30
    ELSE FULFILLED
```

### Exercising a DEONTIC — `#ASSERT` the boolean, `#TRACE` the deontic

**Gotcha:** a `DEONTIC` value **cannot** be `EQUALS`-compared in `#ASSERT`. (This is specific to `DEONTIC`:
an `EITHER` value and an enum constructor carrying fields compare fine — `x EQUALS LEFT y`,
``x EQUALS `the levy is` 200``.) So land your `#ASSERT`s on the
`\`<x> made out\`` BOOLEAN, and *exercise* the guarded deontic via **`#TRACE`\*\* (which residuates it against an
event stream and prints what is left standing).

`ground-9.l4` (a MAY ground):

```l4
#ASSERT `Ground 9 made out`     `claim all-met (deemed suitable, available now)`
#ASSERT NOT `Ground 9 made out` `claim — suitable but unavailable`

-- The court exercises the permission: orders within the deadline.
#TRACE `ground 9 possession order` `claim all-met ...` AT 0 WITH
    PARTY Court DOES `order possession` AT 10
-- The court declines (never orders): MAY's benign omission -> residual FULFILLED, no breach.
```

The residual tells the story: a Part I case residuates to `Court MUST … HENCE FULFILLED`; a benign MAY case
left unexercised stays a standing permission and collapses to `FULFILLED`; a claim where nothing is made out
is `FULFILLED` outright.

## Provenance, repeal, aggregation

### No record-update operator — full literals or a `GIVEN`-parameterised constructor

**Gotcha:** `existingValue WITH field IS v` works **only on a TYPE CONSTRUCTOR** (`MyType WITH …`), never on an
_existing_ record value — applied to a value it parses as function application and errors. There is no in-place
record update.
**Fix:** spell full record literals per scenario, or expose a `GIVEN`-parameterised constructor and partially
apply it, varying just the operative field.

`ground-4A.l4` (the constructor approach):

```l4
-- This L4 builds records only from a type name (`Ground4AClaim WITH ...`); there is no
-- in-place record-update operator. So we expose a GIVEN-parameterised constructor; each
-- test below supplies all fields, varying just the operative one.
GIVEN `is HMO` IS A BOOLEAN  ... `re-let intent` IS A BOOLEAN
GIVETH A Ground4AClaim
`mk claim` MEANS Ground4AClaim WITH
  `dwelling-house is in an HMO or is an HMO` IS `is HMO`
  -- ... all other fields ...
-- then: `probe (e)` MEANS `mk claim` TRUE (LIST `student now`) TRUE TRUE ... varying one field
```

(`ground-6.l4` takes the other road: it spells a FULLY-SPELLED `Ground6Claim WITH …` literal per scenario.)

### Repealed / omitted provision → a labelled stub

**Statute:** a ground that has been repealed/omitted (so the in-order corpus would otherwise have a silent gap).
**Shape:** a `§§`-labelled stub carrying the former text as **inert prose** + the repeal provenance, with **no
operative outcome** (no `DECIDE`/deontic). Keeps the corpus gap-free and auditable.

`ground-3-repealed.l4` (and `part-4-repealed.l4` at Part level):

```l4
§ `Housing Act 1988 — Schedule 2 — Part I — Ground 3 (REPEALED / OMITTED by Renters' Rights Act 2025)`
-- Provenance (Textual Amendment F9):
--   "Sch. 2 Ground 3 omitted (1.5.2026 ...) by virtue of Renters' Rights Act 2025 (c. 26),
--    s. 145(1)(8), Sch. 1 para. 8 ...; S.I. 2026/421, reg. 2(b)"
-- Deliberate STUB so the in-order corpus has no silent gap. NO operative logic, NO outcome.
`former Ground 3 text (REPEALED)` MEANS
        "The tenancy is a fixed term tenancy for a term not exceeding eight months and—"
    ... "(a) ... the landlord gave notice ... that possession might be recovered on this ground; and"
    ... "(b) ... the dwelling-house was occupied under a right to occupy it for a holiday."
#EVAL `former Ground 3 text (REPEALED)`
```

### The genitive supplies the verb — drop it from the field name

**Ruling (Meng).** The Saxon genitive `'s` reads as **both "is" and "has"**. So
`` transfer's `to the issuer of the securities` `` already says _the transfer **is** to the issuer of
the securities_, and `` transfer's `days since the securities were issued` `` already says _the
transfer **has** days since…_. Writing the verb into the field name says it twice.

```l4
-- WRONG — the clitic already supplied "is".
    `is to the issuer of the securities`     IS A BOOLEAN
    `has a date of transfer`                 IS A DATE

-- RIGHT — the name starts at the complement.
    `to the issuer of the securities`        IS A BOOLEAN
    `date of the transfer`                   IS A DATE
```

This is not tidiness. The field name is what the **ladder prints** beside its node and what the
**wizard asks** the user, so a redundant verb is a stutter in the picture and in the question. And
it costs fidelity: 17 CFR 227.501(a)(1) says "To the issuer of the securities" — the statute starts
at the complement too, because its own chapeau ("unless such securities are transferred:") supplied
the verb. Matching that is the whole point.

### Spell the last connective — `..` … `OR`, and `...` … `AND`

**Ruling (Meng, 2026-08-06).** In a chain, **every rung but the last takes the sugar; the last takes
the keyword.**

```l4
-- RIGHT
    ..  "(1)" ... transfer's `to the issuer of the securities`
    ..  "(2)" ... transfer's `to an accredited investor`
    ..  "(3)" ... transfer's `as part of an offering registered with the Commission`
    OR  "(4)" ... `transfer falls within Rule 501(a)(4)` transfer

-- WRONG — the chain never says what kind of chain it is.
    ..  "(1)" ... transfer's `to the issuer of the securities`
    ..  "(2)" ... transfer's `to an accredited investor`
    ..  "(3)" ... transfer's `as part of an offering registered with the Commission`
    ..  "(4)" ... `transfer falls within Rule 501(a)(4)` transfer
```

Three reasons, in increasing order of importance:

1. **It is what the source does.** English coordinates a list asyndetically and then spells the
   conjunction before the final item. 227.501(a) reads "…(3) As part of an offering registered with
   the Commission; **or** (4) To a member of the family…". Legal drafting does this without
   exception, so an isomorphic encoding should too.
2. **The reader learns the operator without counting dots.** `..` and `...` differ by one character.
   A keyword at the foot of the chain says _disjunction_ or _conjunction_ in a word, and it is the
   last thing read before the result.
3. **A chain that ends in sugar looks unfinished** — which is useful, because a chain that ends in
   sugar because someone deleted the final rung _is_ unfinished, and nothing else catches that.

Applies to `...`/`AND` identically. Note this composes with the `AndOrDepth` lint rather than
fighting it: the spelled keyword sits at the same column as the sugar it terminates, and both are
the same operator, so no mixed-operator warning fires.

### When the source supplies no label, DECOMPOSE — never inline the sentence

**Ruling (Meng, 2026-08-06).** The ruling below says: keep the statutory item's label, delete the inert
string that restates the node. It is silent on what to do when **the source numbers a limb but does not
sub-number what is inside it** — and the silence was filled the worst possible way.

17 CFR 227.501(a)(4) is one numbered exception containing four disjuncts, comma-separated, that the CFR
does not label. The corpus **used to encode** it as one BOOLEAN whose name was the whole 288-character
sentence. **Repaired 2026-08-09** — the exhibit below is history, not the present state of the tree.
What it looks like now: six fields under a decision of their own
(`(a)(4) — a family or trust transferee, or a death-or-divorce circumstance`), the ladder figure down
from `viewBox="0 0 2751 440"` to `0 0 1074 440` with a new `regcf-resale-limb-4` beside it, and six
answerable wizard questions in place of the one nobody could answer. Read what follows for the
_defect and its argument_, which are unchanged and are the reason the repair happened; do not read it
as a description of `regcf.l4`.

```l4
-- WRONG. The device, used backwards.
`to a member of the family of the purchaser or the equivalent, to a trust controlled by the
 purchaser, to a trust created for the benefit of a member of the family of the purchaser or
 the equivalent, or in connection with the death or divorce of the purchaser or other similar
 circumstance` IS A BOOLEAN
```

This is inert style **inverted**: the verbatim prose is in the _operative atom_ and there is no inert
scaffolding at all. Everything the device exists to do is defeated. Measured consequences, one cause and
three consumers:

| consumer     | symptom                                                                                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ladder SVG   | `viewBox="0 0 2751 440"` — one leaf ~2000 units wide, the other three tiny                    |
| `.sentences` | "4 ways this can be satisfied", then 300 characters without a break                           |
| wizard       | one question a user cannot answer, and its paraphrase silently dropped the catch-all entirely |

**A field name is a label; a reader does not read it as a proposition.** Four disjuncts hidden inside one
are four forks nobody audits — which is why neither the corpus's fork register nor the independent de novo
pass has an entry here, on the most open-textured phrase in the rule. **Decomposition is detection.** That
is the argument for it, ahead of any diagram getting narrower.

The repair: lift each disjunct to its own short atom and let the **scaffolding** carry the statutory words.
Every leaf gets shorter, because the prose leaves the names.

#### Layout expresses scope even where the operator is associative

The tempting mistake — made and corrected in the session that produced this ruling — is: "`OR` is
associative, so every bracketing has the same truth value, so indentation cannot express the choice."

**False, because inert strings are nodes.** `"of the purchaser"` is not commentary; it is an operand in the
`AND` group, and _which disjuncts fall inside the group it conjoins with_ is exactly what indentation
places. The two readings of the catch-all differ by one line's depth:

```l4
-- The catch-all is a PEER of "the death or divorce of the purchaser":
--   "of the purchaser" does NOT scope it.
    ..  "in connection with" ...    "the" ... `death`
                                          OR `divorce`
                                      ... "of the purchaser"
                            OR  `other similar circumstance`

-- The catch-all is INSIDE that group: "of the purchaser" DOES scope it.
    ..  "in connection with" ...    "the" ... `death`
                                          OR `divorce`
                                          OR `other similar circumstance`
                                      ... "of the purchaser"
```

Same truth value on the same facts; different law. **Scaffolding is structure — treat an inert string's
depth as load-bearing, never as decoration.**

Two things fall out that punctuation cannot do:

1. **Indentation resolves anaphora.** "other **similar** circumstance" — similar to _what_? Placing it as a
   peer of a group makes that group the referent, visibly. The source text does not answer this.
2. **The path is the qualifier.** A leaf named `death` reads out, along the inert strings from root, as
   "in connection with / the / death / of the purchaser" — the isomorphic sentence, assembled rather than
   stored. So keep leaf names short and let the path qualify them. Alpha-conversion (surfaced to the user
   as an index) is the **fallback for leaves with identical paths** — which means the source genuinely
   repeats itself, and the reader should see the index precisely there.

#### Sorts and cardinality are evidence about bracketing

A formalizer has evidence a close reader does not. Use it, and record it as evidence rather than as proof:

- **Sort.** `death` is an unagentive _event_; `divorce` an event or act; `circumstance` is a _state_.
  Coordinating a state with two events at one level is a type error, which argues the catch-all sits one
  level up. **Caveat both ways:** natural language coerces nominals to events routinely, and a sort clash
  is equally readable as _the drafting defect itself_ rather than as a clue to the parse.
- **Cardinality, and the determiner that gives it away.** "**the** death or divorce of the purchaser"
  shares one determiner across a _functional_ term (death: at most one, and terminal) and a _relational_
  one (divorce: a purchaser may marry and divorce twice inside a one-year window). The definite article is
  licensed by the first and not the second — so `"the"` should conjoin with `death` alone, which is again
  a pure indentation change. Downstream this is not cosmetic: the wizard must ask about **a** divorce, not
  **the** divorce.
- **Splitting can change the answer to a different question.** Death is terminal, so the transferor is
  necessarily not the purchaser; divorce leaves the purchaser alive to transfer their own securities. Two
  disjuncts under one number, giving opposite answers to a separate fork — an independent reason to split
  them that owes nothing to legibility.

#### Do NOT decompose a term the source defines

Decomposition is not always right. "a member of the family of the purchaser or the equivalent" has a
syntactic ambiguity (does "or the equivalent" attach to "the purchaser" or to "member of the family"?) and
**§ 227.501(c) defines the entire string as a term of art**. Splitting it would fabricate structure the
regulator explicitly overrode by definition. It stays one atom; what is missing is not decomposition but
the definition, which the corpus does not encode at all.

**Test:** if the source defines the span, it is one atom regardless of how many `or`s are inside it. If the
source merely runs disjuncts together without defining them, decompose.

### Inert never shadows active — quote the label, not the sentence

**Ruling (Meng, 2026-08-03), applied to the Reg CF, BNA and Jersey charities corpora.** An inert string
that restates the words of the active node beside it is **deleted**. What survives is the statutory item's
**label**, truncated, on the **same line as its node**, joined by the `...` continuation token:

```l4
`transfer falls within an exception in Rule 501(a)` transfer MEANS
        "unless such securities are transferred:"
    ..  "(1)" ... transfer's `to the issuer of the securities`
    ..  "(2)" ... transfer's `to an accredited investor`
```

The reason is what a reader sees. A ladder diagram renders inert prose as italic text beside the node it
sits on, so a full quotation next to a field name that already _is_ that quotation prints the same sentence
twice — once as law, once as code — and the reader has to diff them by eye to learn they agree. **The active
node is the authority; the inert string must never compete with it.** The `@ref` above the rule already
carries the citation, so the label is enough to find the source.

Three parts of the ruling that are easy to get wrong:

1. **Same line, joined by `...`.** Two `..` rungs — the label on one, the node on the next — make the label
   its own operand, which is a separate box in the ladder. The `...` join attaches it to the node instead.
2. **ASCII three dots.** `…` is not a token. The lexer says so:
   ```
   11 |   ..  "(1)" … transfer's `to the issuer`
      |             ^
   unexpected '…'
   expecting "'s", "--", "..", "...", "/*", "//", …
   ```
3. **Never bare juxtaposition.** Dropping the `...` is function application, and it type-errors on any
   node whose head is a record binder:

   ```
   You are giving 1 input to

     transfer (defined at single-line.l4:9:21-29) of type Transfer

   but it is not a function, so it takes none.
   ```

   Measured 2026-08-03 (`l4 check` exit 1). The `...` form checks clean, preserves the OR semantics
   ((T,F)→TRUE, (F,F)→FALSE, (F,T)→TRUE) and `l4 format` round-trips it byte-identically.

**Labels do not move into terms.** A field is named for the fact it asserts, not for the paragraph that
asserts it — `` transfer's `to the issuer of the securities` ``, never `` transfer's `501(a)(1)` ``.

**Two strings still stay whole.** A **chapeau** — text ending in a colon or dash that introduces the limbs
below it — keeps its own line, _unless_ its substance duplicates the limbs, in which case it truncates to
its own label like anything else. And an inert string whose content appears in **no** active node stays
verbatim: a deemed fact (BNA s 1(2)(a)-(b), which are deemed rather than tested), a closed permitted-content
list that an active node references only by cross-reference (Reg CF Rule 204(b)(1)-(3)), or a pure
definition carrier whose node is literally `TRUE` (Rule 204(e)). Those are not shadows; they are the only
place the words live.

**The lint.** `etc/go/phases/p3-check.sh` reads the surviving label-only strings within each rule and warns
when a run is out of order. It is **warning level and never affects status**, because — Meng again — "real
legislation goes wobbly": a consolidated Act quotes repealed limbs by omitting them, so `(a) (c) (d)` is
normal and **gaps are counted as information, not as a warning**. The scheme reader
(`etc/go/lib/label-order.mjs`) handles `(1)(2)`, inserted `(1A)`, `(a)(b)` and roman `(i)(ii)(iv)`, and calls
a run disordered only when no scheme orders it — `(i)` is both a letter and a roman one, and guessing wrong
would cry wolf.

### Provenance — pin every inert string; resolve amendments to the in-force reading

**Practice:** pin every inert string to authoritative text. Resolve textual-amendment markers
(omit / insert / renumber) to the **in-force reading**, and carry the amendment provenance as inert prose. Pin it
two ways: a header comment citing the amending Act / section / commencement, and inline inert prose at the
amendment site recording the _omitted_ words plus how the in-force reading was derived.

Header pin + an _omit_ resolved to the in-force text, omitted words kept inert for audit
(`ground-1-amended-2025.l4` / `ground-9.l4`):

```l4
§ `Housing Act 1988 — Schedule 2 — Part I — Ground 1 (amended; Renters' Rights Act 2025)`
-- The amended Ground 1, as substituted by the Renters' Rights Act 2025 (c. 26)
-- (commencement 1.5.2026 for specified purposes). ...

-- F75 (RRA 2025, 1.5.2026) OMITTED the para-2(a) exclusions; carried inert for audit:
    ... "[omitted 1.5.2026: other than— (i) a tenancy in respect of which notice is given ...]"
```

For "ordered on Grounds 1 and 8" explainability, build a **`satisfied grounds`** LIST by `mapMaybe` over
labelled booleans (`possession-decision.l4`):

```l4
`satisfied grounds` cf MEANS
  mapMaybe `label if satisfied` (`pleaded grounds` cf)   -- pleaded grounds :: LIST OF PAIR STRING BOOLEAN
  WHERE
    `label if satisfied` pg MEANS IF pg's snd THEN JUST (pg's fst) ELSE NOTHING
```

### Top-level aggregation (entry point) — two complementary forms

The runnable PoC is `possession-decision.l4`. Two ways to express "what now?":

**Form A — the COURT's decision as a two-tier guarded deontic.** Test the mandatory tier first; else the
discretionary tier (gated on reasonableness); else `FULFILLED`. Do **not** collapse into a flat
`MUST IF (g1 OR … OR g14)` — that would wrongly make discretionary grounds mandatory and drop the reasonableness gate.

```l4
`court possession decision` cf MEANS
    IF   `any Part I ground made out` cf                       -- s.7(3): a mandatory ground
    THEN PARTY Court MUST `order possession` WITHIN 30
    ELSE IF (    `any Part II ground made out` cf               -- s.7(4): a discretionary ground
             AND cf's `it is reasonable to make the order`)    --        AND reasonable
         THEN PARTY Court MAY `order possession` WITHIN 30
         ELSE FULFILLED                                        -- no ground stands
```

**Form B — the obligated/electing party's choice via `ROR`.** Models a genuine election among the _available_
grounds.

> **ROR GOTCHA — the else-FULFILLED trap.** A branch shaped `IF made out THEN MUST … ELSE FULFILLED` is **poison**
> under `ROR`: ROR ("any one fulfils") treats the `FULFILLED` arm as success, so a not-made-out branch makes the
> whole choice fire _trivially_. And `foldr ROR FULFILLED` re-introduces it from the other side —
> `dutyA ROR (dutyB ROR FULFILLED)` collapses to `FULFILLED` immediately.
>
> **Fix:** ROR-fold only the _available_ branches as **UNGUARDED** duties (no `ELSE FULFILLED` short-circuit),
> with a **one-element base case** (the single branch itself) — `FULFILLED` appears **only** in the empty-list case.

```l4
`ror together` branches MEANS
  CONSIDER branches
  WHEN EMPTY               THEN FULFILLED     -- no available ground: nothing to elect
  WHEN d FOLLOWED BY EMPTY THEN d             -- exactly one: that duty, NO FULFILLED tail
  WHEN d FOLLOWED BY rest  THEN d ROR `ror together` rest
-- branches = map `court duty for ground` (`satisfied grounds` cf)  -- only the available grounds
```

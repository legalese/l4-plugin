## `DECIDE`: IS vs MEANS vs IF

L4 has three decision-defining forms. All are valid; pick the one that reads best for the rule you are writing.

```l4
-- Value or computed expression — use IS or MEANS
GIVEN x IS A NUMBER
DECIDE double x IS x TIMES 2

GIVEN n IS A NUMBER
DECIDE factorial n MEANS
    IF n EQUALS 0 THEN 1 ELSE n TIMES factorial (n MINUS 1)

-- Boolean-returning rule — use IF
GIVEN age IS A NUMBER
      income IS A NUMBER
DECIDE `is eligible` IF
    age AT LEAST 18 AND income GREATER THAN 30000

-- DECIDE is optional when using MEANS
GIVEN x IS A NUMBER
double x MEANS x TIMES 2
```

Rule of thumb: **`IF` for booleans, `IS` for values and records, `MEANS` when omitting `DECIDE` entirely.**

---

## The ditto operator `^`

`^` copies the corresponding token from the line above, column-for-column. It is used to flatten repeated chained comparisons without repeating the subject.

```l4
GIVEN phase IS A STRING
sky_is_romantic phase MEANS
       phase EQUALS "full moon"
   OR  ^     ^       "new moon"
   OR  ^     ^       "new"
   OR  ^     ^       "full"
```

Each `^` stands for the token at the same column on the previous line. Without ditto you would repeat `phase EQUALS` four times. This is a legal-drafting affordance, not a general-purpose operator.

---

## Asyndetic operators `...` and `..`

The ellipsis operators are implicit conjunction/disjunction — they let you write a list of conditions without repeating `AND` / `OR` on every line.

- `...` (three dots) — implicit **AND**
- `..` (two dots) — implicit **OR**

```l4
DECIDE `eligible for discount` IF
    `is existing customer`
    ...
    `has clean payment history`
    ...
    `spent at least 1000 this year`
-- equivalent to: cond1 AND cond2 AND cond3
```

Use them when a clause list should read as a bulleted list rather than a prose "A and B and C".

---

## Section markers `§` and `§§`

`§` and `§§` are **structural section markers**, not comments. They are how you preserve the hierarchy of the source legislation or contract in the L4 file:

```l4
§ `Part I — Eligibility`

§§ `1.1 Definitions`

DECLARE Applicant HAS
    ...

§§ `1.2 Conditions for coverage`

GIVEN applicant IS An Applicant
DECIDE `coverage applies` IF
    ...
```

They compile away but show up in the IDE outline and in generated documentation. Use them whenever the source text has sections — it is how the isomorphic-encoding principle is expressed.

---

## Computed fields in records

A record's `HAS` block can include fields whose value is **computed** from other fields via `MEANS`. These are like derived attributes / methods / computed properties in other languages.

```l4
DECLARE Employee HAS
    -- stored fields
    `name`          IS A STRING
    `date of birth` IS A NUMBER
    `current year`  IS A NUMBER
    -- computed fields
    `age`           IS A NUMBER
        MEANS `current year` - `date of birth`
    `adult`         IS A BOOLEAN
        MEANS `age` AT LEAST 18
```

**Rules:**

- Computed fields are accessed with `'s` just like stored fields: `` employee's `age` ``.
- They are **pure** — they may only reference sibling fields of the same record. You cannot add `GIVEN` parameters to a computed field.
- When constructing with `WITH`, you supply **only the stored fields**; computed fields are derived automatically.
- Cycle detection is automatic; the compiler rejects any dependency cycle between computed fields.

## Backtick identifiers and mixfix

Any identifier containing spaces or punctuation must be backtick-quoted:

```l4
`the applicant`
`has valid identification`
`the person must not sell alcohol`
```

**Mixfix notation** lets the function name intersperse with its arguments. The argument positions are the backtick-quoted parameter names:

```l4
GIVEN employee IS AN Employee
      employer IS A Company
GIVETH A BOOLEAN
`employee` `works for` `employer` MEANS ...

-- Called as: `Alice` `works for` `Acme Corp`
```

Mixfix is the reason L4 code can read like legal prose. Use it for binary-ish relations. Use normal prefix-style function names for everything else.

**A backticked segment may begin with punctuation** — a comma, a semicolon, a colon, an opening
bracket — which is what lets a call read as one clause of English rather than a run of unlabelled
arguments. All four were measured at the head of a segment and all four check (probe
`g12-mixfix-punctuation.l4`, exit 0, four assertions satisfied):

```l4
`an expense of` n `, reasonably incurred being` r
`the total of` a `, and` b `; and` c `: and` d
`the fee for` n `hours (at the first band); and` m `hours (at the second band)`
`clause 9: the cap on` n
```

Two limits on what a segment can be:

- **No segment may contain `--`.** That is the comment marker and backticks do not protect it: the
  definition silently ends at the segment before it, so the head is defined at the wrong arity and
  the rest of the line becomes a free identifier. You get two errors and neither says "comment"
  (probe `g12b-mixfix-comment-marker.l4`, exit 1).
- **A pattern with exactly ONE argument may not end with a keyword segment.**
  `` `the sum of` n `rounded down` `` registers `` `the sum of` `` at arity 1 and leaves
  `` `rounded down` `` undefined; the call site then reports `expects 1 argument, but you are
applying it to 2 arguments here` (probe `g12c-mixfix-one-arg-trailing.l4`, exit 1). A trailing
  segment is fine once there are two or more arguments —
  `` `the sum of` n `and` m `rounded down` `` checks (probe `g12d`, exit 0). With one argument,
  either drop the trailing segment or move its words into the head.

Entry 6.10 of the phrasebook,
[source-patterns/06-parties-and-things.md](source-patterns/06-parties-and-things.md#e6-10), shows
what these punctuated segments buy you: a named fact pattern an `#ASSERT` can be applied to on one
line.

---

## Layout sensitivity

L4 is layout-sensitive like Python and Haskell. **Indentation determines block structure.** There are no braces or semicolons.

```l4
GIVEN x IS A NUMBER
GIVETH A STRING
classify x MEANS
    IF x GREATER THAN 0
    THEN "positive"
    ELSE IF x EQUALS 0
        THEN "zero"
        ELSE "negative"
```

The `THEN`/`ELSE` alignment and the indentation of the inner `IF` matter. If you see a "parse error: unexpected token", check indentation first.

---

## No implicit coercion

L4 never silently converts between types. `"42" + 1` is a type error. Use the explicit coercions (`TOSTRING`, `TONUMBER`, `TODATE`, `TOTIME`, `TODATETIME`, `TRUNC`) from [builtins.md](builtins.md). `TONUMBER`/`TODATE`/etc. return `MAYBE` — you must pattern-match with `CONSIDER` to extract the value.

---

## The `daydate` month-subtraction footgun

After `IMPORT daydate`, you build calendar dates with `YMD year month day` (recommended for new code, BOUNDS-CHECKED) or the little-endian `Date day month year` (lenient). **This footgun is `Date`-specific**: `YMD` refuses an out-of-range month instead of clamping — `YMD 2025 (3 MINUS 6) 1` stops on `` `YMD refused an out-of-range month or day` `` where `Date 1 (3 MINUS 6) 2025` silently clamps to January 2025. Use `Date` when you _want_ rolling month arithmetic; use `YMD` for literals.

The constructor does **not** normalise a non-positive month by rolling back a year — it **clamps a month `≤ 0` to January of the same year**. So `Date 1 (3 MINUS 6) 2025` is **January 2025**, _not_ September 2024. Month **overflow** past 12, by contrast, _does_ roll forward correctly: `month PLUS 6` on a December date lands in the next year.

```l4
-- ✘ WRONG — "6 months before March 2025" by subtracting months:
Date 1 (3 MINUS 6) 2025          -- clamps to January 2025, NOT September 2024

-- ✔ RIGHT — compute "N months before X" by ADDING to the EARLIER date,
--           then comparing, so the subtraction never happens:
`became landlord no more than 6 months before proceedings` MEANS
        Day `proceedings commenced date`
    AT MOST Day `six months after became-landlord date`
    WHERE
        `six months after became-landlord date` MEANS
            Date (DATE_DAY   `became-landlord date`)
                 (DATE_MONTH `became-landlord date` PLUS 6)   -- overflow rolls forward, correctly
                 (DATE_YEAR  `became-landlord date`)

-- ✔ RIGHT — to go backward a whole year, decrement the YEAR
--           (this can never produce month ≤ 0, so the clamp never fires):
Date (DATE_DAY x) (DATE_MONTH x) (DATE_YEAR x MINUS 1)
```

**Rule of thumb:** never compute "N months before X" by subtracting months from `X`. Either **add** N months to the earlier date (`DATE_MONTH earlier PLUS N`) and compare, or step back a whole year via `DATE_YEAR … MINUS 1`. The "≤ 6 months before proceedings" tests in the Housing Act corpus (`ground-2ZC.l4`, `ground-2ZD.l4`) do exactly this.

---

## Genitive field access with `'s`

Field access uses the English genitive, not a dot:

```l4
person's age
company's ceo's name          -- chaining
application's employee's nationality
```

This is the ONLY form of field access. No `.field`, no `->`, no `[]`.

---

## `AKA` aliases

`AKA` gives an existing name an alternate name. Both can be used interchangeably:

```l4
GIVEN p IS A Person
DECIDE `is of legal age` p IS p's age AT LEAST 18
    AKA `has reached majority`

-- both of these now work:
#ASSERT `is of legal age`    `Alice`
#ASSERT `has reached majority` `Alice`
```

Use it when the source text uses two names for the same concept and you want both to be searchable.

Reference: <https://legalese.com/l4/reference/functions/AKA.md>

---

## `LET … IN` vs `WHERE`

Both introduce local bindings. Pick by position:

- **`WHERE`** — trailing. Use for helper definitions read _after_ the main expression.
- **`LET … IN`** — leading. Use for a single binding consumed immediately.

```l4
-- WHERE: trailing helpers
circleArea radius IS pi TIMES radius TIMES radius
WHERE
    pi MEANS 3.14159

-- LET ... IN: inline
LET taxRate MEANS 0.08 IN
    price TIMES (1 PLUS taxRate)
```

---

## `@export` placement

`@export` goes **directly above** the function (before `GIVEN` or the bare function name). Not between `GIVETH` and `DECIDE`.

```l4
-- ✘ Wrong — @export in the middle
GIVEN x IS A NUMBER
GIVETH A NUMBER
@export Square a number
squared x MEANS x TIMES x

-- ✔ Right — @export at the top
@export Square a number
GIVEN x IS A NUMBER
GIVETH A NUMBER
squared x MEANS x TIMES x
```

---

## Annotation fence

All annotations begin with `@` and apply to the following definition:

| Annotation | Purpose                                                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `@desc`    | Human-readable description (internal unless paired with `@export`) |
| `@export`  | Mark function for deployment via `jl4-service`                     |
| `@nlg`     | Natural-language-generation hint (for rendering the rule as prose) |
| `@ref`     | Cross-reference to a legal source                                  |
| `@ref-src` | Source of the legal reference                                      |
| `@ref-map` | Mapping table for references                                       |

`@ref` / `@ref-src` / `@ref-map` are the "link this rule to §3.2 of the statute" annotations — use them whenever the source document has stable citations.

---

## NLG and reference annotations

In addition to the `@`-prefixed annotations above, L4 recognises two **inline** annotation bracket forms inside identifiers and expressions:

- `[...]` — NLG inline annotations (hints for rendering the rule as natural language)
- `<<...>>` — reference annotations (inline citations)
- `%...%` — NLG delimiter (wraps a phrase for the NLG renderer)

These are rare in hand-written rules but appear in machine-generated or NLG-bidirectional files. If you see them in existing code, leave them alone — they are meaningful.

---

## A library's own example definitions are visible to importers

A library file may carry fixtures for its own tests, and `IMPORT` brings those names in with the
rest. A file that imports `hierarchy` and defines its own `amended` fails with
`There are multiple definitions for the identifier` naming `hierarchy.l4:298`, one of the
library's own examples (measured 2026-09-05). If a plain name collides with something you did not
define, look in the library you imported, and rename yours.

---

## `EVERY … WHO elem` is deprecated and nothing tells you

This one belongs here rather than only in the regulative reference, because it is the shape a model
trained on older L4 will reach for by default and **no part of the toolchain objects**: it parses,
type-checks, runs, and produces the right answer.

```l4
EVERY Tenant t
    WHO elem t tenants          -- DEPRECATED 2026-09-08. Silent. Do not write it.
```

Before the `IN` clause existed, the group a quantified obligation ranges over — its **roll** — had to
be smuggled into the `WHO` condition as an `elem` test, and the evaluator would pick the list back
out. Since 2026-09-08 the roll is said outright, and the older spelling is deprecated: still
running, not scheduled for removal, and **with no warning of any kind** — no diagnostic, no note in
the trace, no editor mark. Documentation is the only thing that will tell you, which is why it is
written down twice.

The rewrite is mechanical: `WHO elem t xs` becomes `IN xs`, and `WHO elem t xs AND p` becomes
`IN xs WHO p`.

An `elem` condition **beside** an `IN` roll is not this trap — it is an ordinary narrowing
condition and is fine. Only an `elem` standing in for a missing roll is the deprecated form.

See [regulative.md](regulative.md#do-not-write-the-deprecated-who-elem-roll) for why it was
deprecated and what else `EVERY` needs.
